This is just a best guess parts list and I'm honestly unsure on alot of the pricing (Supply issues) But the basics are still cheap and lead acid batteries at this time are easier to get a hold of.

So start with the basic layout and then add-on from that. With this it's important to get rid of the hot\cold side you don't want as they will start to neutralise each other. One side needs to be able to escape the room.

This is as simple or complex as you'd like. I'm always abit unsure about the wrie guide as everyone will use diffrent ways and this is really just for abit of fun & creative outlet. 

In the 3D file I've labeled the solar system and this plugs into your heater base. change the hot or cold by flipping the wires directly or design your own logic gate :) 

Any way I'm gonna shut up about these things now and move on - tho they're still pretty neat.
